Source Maps
===========

In various browsers Sentry supports deminifying JavaScript via source
maps. A source map is a file generated by your minifier which compresses a
mapping of the minified file to the original uncompressed version(s).

One important thing to note is that even though we support mapping files,
a users browser may not actually be able to collect the required
information for the server to generate a sourcemap.

Sentry requires the following to be able to map tracebacks to their source:

* A source map header or footer
* A publicly accessible uncompressed version of the source
* A line of context that includes a line number, column number, and filename

The first two items are the responsibility of you, the end-user, and you
can take care of publishing them as part of your build process. The latter
however, with an individual line of context, is severely crippled in many
browsers.

One thing to note is that Sentry will attempt to process the source map
before storing (or grouping) an event. This ensures that if we are able to
deminify the source, we'll be able to more effectively group similar
events over time.

Browser Support
---------------

In our experiences, the only browser that routinely delivers usable error
reports is **Google Chrome**.

For additional information, see this more up-to-date `wiki page
<https://github.com/ryanseddon/source-map/wiki/Source-maps:-languages,-tools-and-other-info>`_.

Generating a Source Map
-----------------------

While there are several compression libraries which support source maps,
as of writing our recommendation is to use `UglifyJS
<https://github.com/mishoo/UglifyJS2>`_. That said, many tools such as
`webpack <http://webpack.github.io/>`_ and `browserify
<http://browserify.org/>`_.

As an example, we can look at how we used to do things with Sentry (pre-webpack):

::

    node_modules/uglify-js/bin/uglifyjs {input} \
      --source-map-root={relroot}/ \
      --source-map-url={name}.map.js \
      --source-map={relpath}/{name}.map.js -o {output}

We won't attempt to go into the complexities of source maps, so we
recommend taking a stab at compiling them, and running them against a
validator.

Validating a Source Map
-----------------------

We maintain an online validation tool that can be used to test your source
(and sourcemaps) against: `sourcemaps.io <http://sourcemaps.io>`_.

Uploading Source Maps to Sentry
-------------------------------

In many cases your application may sit behind firewalls or you simply
can't expose source code to the public. Sentry provides an abstraction
called **Releases** which you can attach source artifacts to.

The release API is intended to allow you to store source files (and
sourcemaps) within Sentry. This removes the requirement for them to be
web-accessible, and also removes any inconsistency that could come from
network flakiness (on either your end, or Sentry's end).

You can either interact with the API directly or you can upload sourcemaps
with the help of the Sentry CLI (:ref:`upload-sourcemaps-with-cli`).

* Start by creating a new authentication token under **[Account] > API**.
* Ensure you you have ``project:write`` selected under scopes.
* You'll use the Authorization header with the value of ``Bearer: {TOKEN}``
  with API requests.

Now you need to setup your build system to create a release, and attach
the various source files. You will want to upload all dist files (i.e. the
minified/shipped JS), the referenced sourcemaps, and the files that those
sourcemaps point to.

.. code-block:: bash

    # Create a new release
    $ curl https://app.getsentry.com/api/0/projects/:organization_slug/:project_slug/releases/ \
      -X POST \
      -H 'Authorization: Bearer {TOKEN}' \
      -H 'Content-Type: application/json'
      -d '{"version": "2da95dfb052f477380608d59d32b4ab9"}' \

    {
      "dateCreated": "2015-03-06T04:51:32.723Z",
      "version": "2da95dfb052f477380608d59d32b4ab9"
    }

When uploading the file, you'll need to reference it just as it would be referenced
if a browser (or filesystem) had to resolve its path. So for example, if your sourcemap
reference is just a relative path, it's relative to the location of the referencing file.

So for example, if you have ``http://example.com/app.min.js``, and the file contains the
reference to ``app.map.js``, the name of the uploaded file should be ``http://example.com/app.map.js``.

.. code-block:: bash

    # Upload a file for the given release
    $ curl https://app.getsentry.com/api/0/projects/:organization_slug/:project_slug/releases/2da95dfb052f477380608d59d32b4ab9/files/ \
      -X POST \
      -H 'Authorization: Bearer {TOKEN}' \
      -F file=@app.js.map \
      -F name="http://example.com/app.js.map"

    {
      "dateCreated": "2015-03-06T04:53:00.308Z",
      "headers": {
        "Content-Type": "application/octet-stream"
      },
      "id": "1",
      "name": "http://example.com/app.js.map",
      "sha1": "22591348ed129fe016c535654f6493737f0f9df6",
      "size": 452
    }

.. code-block:: bash

    # If you make a mistake, you can also simply clear out the release
    $ curl https://app.getsentry.com/api/0/projects/:organization_slug/:project_slug/releases/2da95dfb052f477380608d59d32b4ab9/ \
      -H 'Authorization: Bearer {TOKEN}' \
      -X DELETE

Additionally, you'll need to configure the client to send the ``release``:

.. code-block:: javascript

    Raven.config({
        release: '2da95dfb052f477380608d59d32b4ab9'
    });

Note: You dont *have* to upload the source files (ref'd by sourcemaps),
but without them the grouping algorithm will not be as strong, and the UI
will not show any contextual source.

Additional information can be found in the `Releases API documentation
<https://docs.getsentry.com/hosted/api/releases/>`_.


.. _assets_multiple_origins:

.. admonition:: Assets Accessible at Multiple Origins

    It's not uncommon for a web application to be accessible at multiple
    origins. For example:

    * Website is operable over both ``https`` and ``http``
    * Geolocated web addresses: e.g. ``https://us.example.com``, ``https://eu.example.com``
    * Multiple static CDNs: e.g. ``https://static1.example.com``, ``https://static2.example.com``
    * Customer-specific domains/subdomains

    In this situation, **identical** JavaScript and source map files may be located
    at two or more distinct origins. If you are dealing with such a deployment, you have
    two choices for naming your uploaded artifacts:

    1. Upload the same artifact multiple times with each possible URL where it appears, for example:

        * https://static1.example.com/js/app.js
        * https://static2.example.com/js/app.js

    2. Alternatively, you can omit the protocol + host and use a special tilde (~) prefixed path like so:

        ~/js/app.js

    The ~ prefix tells Sentry that for a given URL, **any** combination of protocol and hostname whose path is
    ``/js/app.js`` should use this artifact. **ONLY** use this method if your source/sourcemap files
    are identical at all possible protocol/hostname combinations. Note that Sentry will prioritize
    full URLs over tilde prefixed paths if found.


.. _upload-sourcemaps-with-cli:

Using Sentry CLI
----------------

You can also use the Sentry :ref:`sentry-cli` to manage releases and
sourcemaps on Sentry.  If you have it installed you can create releases
with the following command::

    $ sentry-cli releases -o MY_ORG -p MY_PROJECT new 2da95dfb052f477380608d59d32b4ab9

After you have run this, you can use the `files` command to automatically
add all javascript files and sourcemaps below a folder.  They are
automatically prefixed with a URL or your choice::

    $ sentry-cli releases -o MY_ORG -p MY_PROJECT files \
      2da95dfb052f477380608d59d32b4ab9 upload-sourcemaps --url-prefix \
      https://mydomain.invalid/static /path/to/assets

.. admonition:: Assets Accessible at Multiple Origins

    If you leave out the ``--url-prefix`` parameter the paths will be
    prefixed with ``~/`` automatically to support multi origin behavior.

All files that end with `.js` and `.map` below `/path/to/assets` are
automatically uploaded to the release `2da95dfb052f477380608d59d32b4ab9`
in this case.  If you want to use other extensions you can provide it with
the ``--ext`` parameter.

.. admonition:: Validating Sourcemaps

    Unfortunately it can be quite challenging to ensure that sourcemaps
    are actually valid themselves and uploaded correctly.  To ensure
    that everything is working as intended you can use the `--validate`
    flag when uploading sourcemaps which will attempt to locally parse the
    sourcemap and look up the references.  Note that there are known cases
    where the validate flag will indicate failures when the setup is
    correct (if you have references to external sourcemaps then the
    validation tool will indicate a failure).

    Here are some things you can check in addition to the validation step:

    *   Make sure that the URL prefix is correct for your files.  This is
        easy to get wrong.
    *   Make sure you upload the matching sourcemaps for your minimized
        files.
    *   Make sure that your minified files you have on your servers
        actually have references to your files.

Working Behind a Firewall
-------------------------

While the recommended solution is to upload your source artifacts to
Sentry, sometimes it's necessary to allow communication from Sentry's
internal IPs. For more information on Sentry's public IPs, see :ref:`ip-ranges`.

Troubleshooting
---------------

Source maps can sometimes be tricky to get going. If you're having trouble, try the following tips.

Verify sourceMappingURL is present
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Some CDNs automatically strip comments from static files, including JavaScript files. This can have the effect of stripping your JavaScript file of its ``sourceMappingURL`` directive, because it is considered a comment. For example, CloudFlare has a feature called `Auto-Minify
<https://blog.cloudflare.com/an-all-new-and-improved-autominify/>`_ which will strip ``sourceMappingURL`` if it is enabled.

Double-check that your deployed, final JavaScript files have ``sourceMappingURL`` present.

Verify artifact names match sourceMappingURL
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When `uploading source maps to Sentry
<#uploading-source-maps-to-sentry>`_, you must name your source map files with the same name found in ``sourceMappingURL``.

For example, if you have the following in a minified application file, ``app.min.js``:

.. code-block:: javascript

    //-- end app.min.js
    //# sourceMappingURL=https://example.com/dist/js/app.min.js.map

Sentry will look for a matching artifact named exactly ``https://example.com/dist/js/app.min.js.map``.

Note also that Sentry will resolve relative paths. For example, if you have the following:

.. code-block:: JavaScript

    // -- end app.min.js (located at https://example.com/dist/js/app.min.js)
    //# sourceMappingURL=app.min.js.map

Sentry will resolve ``sourceMappingURL`` relative to ``https://example.com/dist/js/`` (the root path from which ``app.min.js`` was served). You will again need to name your source map with the full URL: ``https://example.com/dist/js/app.min.js.map``.

If you serve the same assets from multiple origins, you can also alternatively use our tilde (~) path prefix to ignore
matching against protocol + hostname. In which case, ``~/dist/js/app.min.js.map``, will also work. See: `Assets Accessible at Multiple Origins
<#assets-multiple-origins>`_.

Verify artifacts are uploaded before errors occur
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Sentry expects that source code and source maps in a given release are uploaded to Sentry **before** errors occur in that release.

If you upload artifacts **after** an error is captured by Sentry, Sentry will not go back and retroactively apply any source annotations to those errors. Only new errors triggered after the artifact was uploaded will be affected.

Verify your source files are not too large
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For an individual artifact, Sentry accepts a max filesize of **20 MB**.

Often users hit this limit because they are transmitting source files at an interim build stage. For example, after Webpack/Browserify has combined all
your source files, but before minification has taken place. If possible, send the original source files.
